<h3>Course Description</h3>
                    <p>
				   The course provided an introduction to DFM methodologies and tools; material selection (new and traditional materials); designing for primary manufacturing processes (cutting fundamentals, casting, forming, and shaping); designing with plastics (snap-fits, integral hinges, etc.); design for assembly (DFA); geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T). Throughout the course, we completed 10 mini projects which were designed to help us comprehend various modern manufacturing options, to better understand a designer's and manufacturer's viewpoints, and to understand how to create optimal designs based on best practices for design-for-manufacturability.
                  </p>
				   <br>
 <h3>Mini Project 1: Introduction to DFM</h3>
                    <p>
				   For the first project, my group analyzed and took apart a Razor scooter. During this process we learned about how the scooter was assembled, and estimated the materials for each part. We also discussed which parts are product-specific, the different manufacturing processes involved in the production of the scooter, and created a process framework.
                  </p>

 <h3>Mini Project 2: Metals Casting</h3>
                    <p>
				   For the second project, our my group looked at a gas valve and a pan to learn more about metal casting. By looking at the physical characteristics of each of these parts, we were able to conclude where we though gate (or gates) was (were) placed to fill the molds, where air vents were located, and which metals and alloys have been used in these castings.

 <h3>Mini Project 3: Sheet Metal Forming</h3>
                    <p>
				   From Mack's Recyling Yard, we found a Baking Pan Made and a Letter "A" that were manufactured using sheet metal forming. Along with analyzing the formability of different materials and the six manufacturing methods for forming double-curved parts, we also contacted a stakeholder to learn more about the baking pan. We had a few questions answered from a Senior Design Engineer at Lloyd Pans.

 <h3>Mini Project 4: Machining</h3>
                    <p>
				   Our group found a Diaphragm Valve Holder at Mack's Recyling Yard that appeared to be machined. This part was produced from a solid block of aluminum and  demonstrates integral machining. Milling was the process used to work this piece down from a solid block of aluminum. In this project we also analyzed which materials were the easiest to machine, and compared the different kinds of drills that are typically used to machine.

 <h3>Mini Project 5: 3D Printing</h3>
                    <p>
				   We disassembled a desk lamp, create an accompanying bill of materials complete with the name of the part, its function, dimensions, mass, and likely manufacturing process and material. Using a selection decision (Pugh) matrix, we identifed which of the product parts were
                   most suitable for fused deposition modeling (FDM) in the University's Innovation Studio. We modeled the base of the lamp in Creo and had it 3D printed. We compared it to the original, plastic injection molded, base.

 <h3>Mini Project 6: Plastic Injection Molding</h3>
                    <p>
				   One of our team members noticed that her father's worn out Skil brand Corner Sander 7200 had a multitude of plastic-injection molded components. In the report, we discuss the  Skil brand Corner Sander 7200 and its components, the six commodity plastics, estimated the pressure difference required to fill a cell phone housing in one tenth of a second, created a process framework for the sander, and more.

 <h3>Mini Project 7: Joining and Assembly</h3>
                    <p>
				   We found products that showed signes of welding, brazing and soldering, adhesive bonding, mechanical fastening, and joining using form closures. We discussed the joint geometries involved in these products, compared the five common welding techniques, as well as did  example problems involing strength of materials.

 <h3>Mini Project 8: Forging</h3>
                    <p>
				   We obtained two forged tools to analyze in this project, the first being a pair of tongue and
                     groove pliers (more commonly known by the proprietary eponym Channellocks) and the second being a steel hammer. Along with discussing these products, we graphed true compressive stress against true compressive strain, estimated yield stress, researched the values for the carbon
                     content (C) that designate the boundaries between groups of steel, and other similar topics.

 <h3>Mini Project 9: Composites</h3>
                    <p>
				  For the last group project, we discussed a recycled car, fiberglass pool, and spirit aircraft spoiler. All of these were perfect examples of resin transfer molding (RTM) products. Our group compared pressure controlled RTM, volume-controlled RTM, and resin infusion, solved problems using Darcy's equation, and elaborated how “Internal runners” can be deployed as a design strategy to minimize injection time.

 <h3>Mini Project 10: Design for Recycling</h3>
                    <p>
				  For the final project, I was tasked to find an existing product and redesign it to be more cost-efficient and sustainable. After reverse-engineering their product, I had to redesigning a component or sub-assembly of the product to improve its design as well as its disposal. I redseigned the front cover and the switch on a wireless light switch. I eliminated the four connecting screws on the front cover and the axel in the switching mechanism.
