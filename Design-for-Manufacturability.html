<h3>Course Description</h3>
                    <p>
				   The course provided an introduction to DFM methodologies and tools; material selection (new and traditional materials); designing for primary manufacturing processes (cutting fundamentals, casting, forming, and shaping); designing with plastics (snap-fits, integral hinges, etc.); design for assembly (DFA); geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T). Throughout the course, we completed 10 mini projects which were designed to help us comprehend various modern manufacturing options, to better understand a designer's and manufacturer's viewpoints, and to understand how to create optimal designs based on best practices for design-for-manufacturability.
                  </p>

 <h3>Mini Project 1: Introduction to DFM</h3>
                    <p>
				   For the first project, my group analyzed and took apart a Razor scooter. During this process we learned about how the scooter was assembled, and estimated the materials for each part. We also discussed which parts are product-specific, the different manufacturing processes involved in the production of the scooter, and created a process framework.

 <h3>Mini Project 2: Metals Casting</h3>
                    <p>
				   For the second project, our my group looked at a gas valve and a pan to learn more about metal casting. By looking at the physical characteristics of each of these parts, we were able to conclude where we though gate (or gates) was (were) placed to fill the molds, where air vents were located, and which metals and alloys have been used in these castings.

 <h3>Mini Project 3: Sheet Metal Forming</h3>
                    <p>
				   From Mack's Recyling Yard, we found a Baking Pan Made and a Letter "A" that were manufactured using sheet metal forming. Along with analyzing the formability of different materials and the six manufacturing methods for forming double-curved parts, we also contacted a stakeholder to learn more about the baking pan. We had a few questions answered from a Senior Design Engineer at Lloyd Pans.

 <h3>Mini Project 10: Design for Recycling</h3>
                    <p>
				  For the final project, I was tasked to find an existing product and redesign it to be more cost-efficient and sustainable. After reverse-engineering their product, I had to redesigning a component or sub-assembly of the product to improve its design as well as its disposal.
